## 2026-02-14 - [Backend Caching & Frontend Component Optimization]
**Learning:** Collection-wide 'distinct' queries in MongoDB are expensive operations (O(N) scans if not perfectly indexed). Static or slow-changing data like movie genres/types are prime candidates for TTL caching to reduce database load and improve API response times. Additionally, in React, moving static objects like animation variants outside of the component prevents unnecessary object allocations on every render, which is particularly beneficial for components rendered in large lists like 'MovieCard'.
**Action:** Always consider simple in-memory TTL caching for relatively static metadata fetched via expensive DB queries. Follow React performance patterns by moving static configuration outside of component functions.
